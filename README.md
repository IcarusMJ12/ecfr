# eCFR Analysis Website

## Setup

You'll need the latest version of `python3`.
It's strongly recommended you then pre-warm the cache by running `./ecfr.py` as
that will fetch and analyze all the titles, which takes a while.  From then on
it will only retrieve updated documents.


## (Optional) Running the web server

`python -m http.server 8000`
